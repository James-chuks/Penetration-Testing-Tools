## Code Signing Certificate Cloning Attack 

A Powershell script that signs input Executable file with fake Microsoft code-signing certificate to demonstrate risks of cloned-certificate sign attacks.

Script was shamelessly borrowed from [Matt Graeber, @mattifestation](https://twitter.com/mattifestation) and his research titled:
- [_Code Signing Certificate Cloning Attacks and Defenses_](https://posts.specterops.io/code-signing-certificate-cloning-attacks-and-defenses-6f98657fc6ec) 

**All credits go to Matt** - this directory contains a copy of his code (_a little tweaked by me_) for preserverance purposes.


### Effectiveness

As of [13/07/2022](https://twitter.com/mariuszbit/status/1547320418821980160) this **dumb trick** still gets off the shelf malware evade detection of at least 8 modern security scanners.
