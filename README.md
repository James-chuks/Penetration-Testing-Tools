## A collection of my Penetration Testing Tools, Scripts, Cheatsheets

This is a collection of more than a **180+** tools, scripts, cheatsheets, and other loots that I've been developing over the years for Penetration Testing and IT Security audit purposes. 
Most of them came in handy at least once during my real-world engagements.

**Notice:** To clone this repository properly - use `--recurse-submodules` switch:
```
git clone --recurse https://github.com/James-chuks/Penetration-Testing-Tools.git
```

Most of these files were initially shared on my [Gists](https://github.com/James-chuks) but eventually reprogrammed into this repository.

Every time I stumbled upon a problem that could be better scripted or resolved programmatically - I made an effort to do just that and thus improve my technical assurance capabilities or optimize time spent on repetitive actions during projects I've been delivering. 

The collection is divided further into the following sections:

- `clouds` - Tools I came up with during my cloud assessments
- `file-formats` - file-format-related utilities, fuzzers, and alike.
- `Linux` - a small bunch of Linux-based scripts and tools.
- `networks` - Network devices & protocols Penetration Testing Tools
- `others` - Others related somehow to this craftsmanship
- `phishing` - Scripts and tools used to deliver Phishing Awareness and Red Team simulations 
- `red-teaming` - Lots of toolings I've been using during my Purple/Red-Teaming engagements
- `web` - Web applications security assessment-related utilities.
- `Windows` - Windows goodies, scripts, exploits.

The base of these tools does not contain any customer/client-related sensitive information, and there are no engagement-specific tools developed as PoCs.
